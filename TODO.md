1. get onto LiSC and do development there.
2. Make pushes to github
   - Learn how to submit a job to SLURM
3. Command line interface - make CLI interface to input different |A|, |B|
4. Make the program run until it finds all possible combinations of (A_n, B_m) (B_m, A_n) - We want this number of cycles (eventually we will parallelize this and perfom many trials to get the average number
5. make a PDF output
