  - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05936-6 

- measure convergence time for A-to-B and B-to-A
  - improve that part of the algorithm (end the loop as soon as one gene is not converged?)
  
## at some point

- (macrosynteny) DCJ
- expand interactions to a window beyond the nearest neighbor genes
